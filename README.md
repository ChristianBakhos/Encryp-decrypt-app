The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary libraries required for the application to function properly. 
To set up the project, simply install these dependencies by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal. 
Once the libraries are installed, you can execute the App.py file using the command python App.py to launch the application. 
After running the app, you will be presented with a registration page where you can sign up using your email and choose a password. 
Once registered, you will be required to log in, and then you'll be all set to start using the application's features for secure file encryption and decryption.
